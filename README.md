# NYC-Neighborhoods--Data-Science-Project
This project analyzes New York City subway stations along a selected subway line to explore what neighborhood features contribute to a higher Niche ranking (overall neighborhood quality score). Each station was paired with neighborhood related data, including walkability scores, Niche ratings, average household income, and average age. After cleaning and organizing the dataset, visualizations were created to examine relationships between demographic factors and Niche scores, helping identify which characteristics are most strongly associated with highly ranked neighborhoods.
